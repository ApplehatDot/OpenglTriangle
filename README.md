# OpenGL Sample - Spinning rainbow triangle
This repository is a rewrite of a sample project featured on **Bloodshed Dev-C++ IDE**<br>
The original structure of the project made use of the Windows API `<windows.h>` and Graphical
Library `<gl/gl.h>` which made the app non-cross-platform. Because the rewritten version 
`"freeglut_triangle.c"` uses freeglut library and glut, it can be compiled for different OS'<br><br>

the `"Original_triangle.c"` is an original source code of sample triangle project.<br>
